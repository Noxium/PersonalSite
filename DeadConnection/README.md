# Insertion Anomaly

You are: a humble rover. You were sent here from Earth to determine this planet’s feasibility for human occupation. You have two robotic arms with an exchangeable head, and an RTG that generates power at all times. This planet is cold as hell, and not breathable in the slightest. Regardless, your team managed to secure enough funding for this project and send you on your way. Trouble is, with these cheap rockets, all sorts of things can go wrong. Despite a successful landing for the rover, you lost all contact with the network of communication sats that were designed to control you, and now you’re on your own. Hopefully the backup A.I. is good enough to figure out a way to re-establish connection. Mine for materials, design elaborate systems, befriend alien critters, avoid hot magma, and launch a network of satellites to figure out a way to get back in contact with Earth.

More coming soon!
